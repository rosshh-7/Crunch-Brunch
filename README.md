This project aims to create a system to help users to order brunch from Everyday Brunch Restaurant. The website allows users to register first and then log in and search for their favourite brunch items from the restaurantâ€™s menu. Further, the user can also place an order online using the website and receive an order confirmation on his/her specified email. The system also allows users to add reviews of their orders.
